# Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning

## Description
There are several types of common concrete cracks namely hairline cracks which
usually develop in concrete foundation as the concrete cures, shrinkage cracks which
occur while the concrete is curing, settlement cracks which happen when part of
concrete sinks or when the ground underneath the slab isn’t compacted properly as
well as structural cracks which form due to incorrect design.

Concrete cracks may endanger the safety and durability of a building if not being
identified quickly and left untreated. By creating an image classification model to 
identify cracks and non cracks concrete, this could potential save thousands of lives.

The dataset can be obtained from this website:https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2

## Results
The dataset consist of two files which is Negative (No Cracks) and Positive (Cracks). Each dataset
consist of 20,000 Images.

The accuracy obtained from training with this dataset manage to obtained an accuracy of 99%
